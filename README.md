Hearthstone Secrets Revealed
============================

A website that lets peopel figure out what secrets the opposition has played in Hearthstone. It tells
the user what the possible actions are and allows them to filter out cards based on what should have
triggered a secret. This was mostly an experiment to try out React and I don't plan to updated it for new cards. 
The site is live at [hearthstonesecretsrevealed.com](http://hearthstonesecretsrevealed.com/).
